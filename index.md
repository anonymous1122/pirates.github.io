TypeFace - Substratum & CMTE v1.1.4 [Premium]
Requirements: Android OS 5.0+
Overview: With TypeFace all Google Web Fonts are just a click away for use with Cyanogen Theme Engine or Substratum! Generate font themes on the fly by downloading fonts available on Google Fonts (http://fonts.google.com). For the power user, TypeFace also provides the option of creating font themes by importing fonts from archives (ZIP/APK) or font files (TTF/OTF).

TypeFace doesn't work on:
- CM14 which doesn't have a theme engine yet
- ROMs without Substratum OMS commits/Masquerade app (Substratum app alone is not enough for font themes to work)
